# README | Mark It Down Wordpress - a wordpress markdown plugin

- This plugin is for those who want to write in Markup language.
- This plugin sits on top of the giant Jetpack.com
- This plugin is an extraction of the 'markdown' module from Jetpack to work separately and independently of Jetpack and hence beneficial for people like myself who does not use Jetpack
- I will maintain this package, it's not a one-off thing.
- Likewise, feel free to contribute and make pull request to help keep thing updated and in good shape for the best interest of the wordpress world.
